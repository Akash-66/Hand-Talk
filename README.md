Communication is the main channel between people to communicate with each other. In the recent years, there has been rapid increase in the number of deaf and dumb victims due to birth defects, accidents and oral diseases. Since deaf and dumb people cannot communicate with normal people, so they have to depend on other pepole. Sometimes people interpret these messages wrongly, increasing the communication gap between them. Also specially challenged people have improper guidance of sign language. The proposed project is made in such a way to help these specially challenged people to hold equal part in the society and act as a virtual teacher for them, so they can enhance their sign knowledge.
